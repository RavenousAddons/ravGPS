*Four lefts and a right and you're there!*

Type /gps to get your coordinates.

Or you can pass in specific coordinates: /gps 12.34 56.78.

You can share your coordinates to different channels even if they don't have the AddOn: /gps share guild, /gps share whisper NAME(-SERVER).

The AddOn can even set a map pin when you're typically unable to for your current map.
