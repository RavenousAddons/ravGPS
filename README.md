*Let people know where you/your target are!*

Type /gps to get your/your target's coordinates.

You can send your coordinates to different channels, like party, guild, instance, or whisper: /gps guild, /gps whisper NAME.

The AddOn can even set a map pin when you're typically unable to for your current map.
